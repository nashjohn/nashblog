            <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this blog just to build. Doing a network chuck tutorial. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it because I been sitting on what to write. I found a new church and the pastor asked me a question. So lets answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do i want or can see in my future? do i want to be married? Do I want children?  What carrier would you like? ect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought much about my future. Not for awhile. I been living in the past, in past rejections and surviving.  I still need to talk about my past to get to the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>What do i want or can see in my future? do i want to be married? Do I want children?  What carrier would you like? ect.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is I haven&rsquo;t thought much about my future. Not for awhile. I been living in the past, in past rejections and surviving.  I still need to talk about my past to get to the future.</p>
<p>12 years ago. On my knees weeping asking god to use me. I had just gotten baptized in 2010, torn between going to my country church like there has got to be more than just this with Jesus.  When i would go to church it as me and everyone grand parents. But for everyone in my life who didn&rsquo;t who needed prayer. the community just never listened to me.</p>
<p>I found myself alone. not really a community as a christian and obviously not meant to fit in with the world. One my best friends growing up called from California. I was getting hope and faith again. He found himself in a spot where someone was shaming him for something he did do to another. So i had an opportunity to talk about Jesus and his forgiveness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever know how he felt or what he did with that. But he got in his car drove to Colorado. Went up first thing with his boys. Five people died that day in avalanche. I knew my friend i thought maybe he changed his mind last minute. Maybe it was just a rumor.</p>
<p>I left church early drove to his parents house. When i saw his fathers face I knew. I stayed with his parents as they searched for his body in the snow. i always would cry broken heart when dumped or whatever but this, part of me died that day with him that just wasn&rsquo;t the same. 35 years of friendship.</p>
<p>My relationship with my father was rocky. i was living with him even though i was an adult. but friend moved back to town. Someone I&rsquo;ve known for a very long time whom was like a big brother to me. So i was going to move in with him and his daughter. I went to go play music with him. we talked for like 7 hours and played nothing.  He had gone to bible school but was kicked out and gave up the faith to the point when i was baptized with love in his heart he was telling me its not true. I stood ground.</p>
<p>it was a nice talk. told him. how felt cursed if i get close to anyone they&rsquo;ll die. we shared our hearts. He told me as we gave one another a hug that he believes in that stuff and i said don&rsquo;t going dying on me.</p>
<p>It was on the way back from a macklemore concert my high school art teacher called, so Muff&rsquo;s dead old boy. I was like what? I just talked to him. This is only three weeks after the avalanche. My tears came down so much i couldn&rsquo;t drive.</p>
<p>The girl was off cheating on me just thought i was some unhappy person. But when i found out in myself and was certain, i yelled and ripped into her. where she was crying and saying your not christian.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a journey those words, &ldquo;your not christian.&rdquo; This was part of a journey i started to find out what just that meant. I needed to find the truth, i needed to find Jesus. I made deal if He would talk all the pain away i would live for him.</p>
<p>The future, well.  twelve years and i think i have the understanding i need now. I think part of gods process is crushing a person. Even the word as you apply to your life cuts like a sword. If you think of Jesus in the garden were he prayed and sweated blood going to his cross. It wasn&rsquo;t just any garden. It was the exact olive orchard they used for the temple anointing oil. That they would crush to make. Its better to surrender to god, your pride, your everything. I know with me the crushing did not need to last as long as it did but it was on me.</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me wrong i would life a wife and children on mountain and live a simple life. But i have to serve him and i have to tell them his coming. He is coming back.</p>
<p>I tried to do everything in my own strength and learned the hard way its just about having a relationship with him and being obedient no matter what he says. I learned god is a match maker (Derrick prince). I learned if you walk in his will, your life will be rigged in his favor (Kevin zadai).  That&rsquo;s all i want to see in my future. whatever the lord desired of me when i was born. Whatever he wrote in the book about me when he created me.  That is what i want for myself and the people i love.  i want to see peoples hearts return to Jesus.  When i pass i want Satan to be relieved.</p>
<p>Right now i want to rest and heal and get back to the lord. I let rejection direct my whole life and I see an end to that in the future.</p>
