      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started this blog just to build. Doing a network chuck tutorial. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished it because I been sitting on what to write. I found a new church and the pastor asked me a question. So lets answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do i want or can see in my future? do i want to be married? Do I want children?  What carrier would you like? ect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth of the matter is I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought much about my future. Not for awhile. I been living in the past, in past rejections and surviving.  I still need to talk about my past to get to the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
